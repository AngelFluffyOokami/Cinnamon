# Cinnamon

Cinnamon is a discord bot in development, planned to have many features, as well as focus on self-hosting, while also providing a public hosted bot for those who don't want to deal with hosting fees.
Some of its core features will include:
- Golang
- Integrated SQLite to facilitate an easy installation process instead of having to deal with setting up a database manually
- Functions powered by schemas, similar to YAGPDB's custom command feature, non-compiled plugins that will form the commands a bot has.
- Separate web control panel hosted by myself, where users will create an account on my website, and generate an API key, used to link the bot to the web control panel hosted by me. (Will also release as open source)
- Golang
- Function schemas also have the ability to manage what appears on the web control panel, say you add a new function, like a message log, well that schema will add a message log section to the web control panel.
